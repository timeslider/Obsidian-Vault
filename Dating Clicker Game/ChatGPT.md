Ohhh I love this idea ❤️ An incremental game where instead of mining gold or clicking cookies, you’re "leveling up" a relationship feels super fresh! I’ll give you a **progression ladder of relationship stages**, from the most distant to the most intimate. Not every relationship follows all steps, but you can mix and match for pacing/gameplay.

### 🧊 Strangers & Acquaintances

- Strangers
    
- Passing acquaintances (seen once or twice)

### 💡 Gameplay-wise

You could also sprinkle in **non-linear side-branches**:

- **Work buddies → business partners**
    
- **Childhood friends → reunited later**
    
- **Frenemies → rivals → respect → friends again**
    
- **Unrequited love → bittersweet resolution**

Would you like me to **arrange this as a single linear ladder** (like an XP progression tree), or more like a **skill tree** where relationships can branch in different emotional directions (friendship path, romance path, rivalry path, etc.)?
